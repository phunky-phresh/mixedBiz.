## Project outline
mixedBiz is an idea to streamline the live music booking process. By creating a specific social platform for live performers to connect with venues, mixedBiz aims to create a simpler and easier booking system, while also creating better relationships between artists and performance spaces.

### Version 1

At this stage the realtime messaging capability is up and running. Users are able to find other user profiles and create a messaging thread to communicate.
